# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Open Lovable - AI-Powered React App Builder

### Product Overview
Open Lovable is an AI-powered development platform that enables users to build React applications through natural language conversations. Users can describe what they want to build, and the AI generates complete, functional React components with modern styling and best practices.

### Core Features

#### 1. AI-Powered Code Generation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert user descriptions into production-ready React code
- **Multi-Model Support**: Support for GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4, and Kimi K2 Instruct
- **Streaming Generation**: Real-time code generation with live preview
- **Intelligent Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and project context

#### 2. Live Development Environment
- **E2B Sandbox Integration**: Isolated development environments with 15-minute timeouts
- **Vite Development Server**: Fast development with hot module replacement
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant preview of generated applications
- **Automatic Package Installation**: Smart detection and installation of npm packages

#### 3. Code Management & Editing
- **Surgical Editing**: Precise modifications to existing code without full regeneration
- **File Structure Intelligence**: Smart file organization and component architecture
- **Context-Aware Updates**: Targeted edits based on user requests
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain project evolution

#### 4. UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS implementation
- **Interactive File Explorer**: Visual representation of project structure
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time code preview with syntax highlighting
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during generation and compilation

### Target Users

#### Primary Users
- **Developers**: Rapid prototyping and component generation
- **Product Managers**: Quick mockup creation and validation
- **Designers**: Converting designs to functional React components
- **Entrepreneurs**: Building MVPs without extensive coding knowledge

#### Secondary Users
- **Students**: Learning React development patterns
- **Teams**: Collaborative application development
- **Agencies**: Fast client project delivery

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend (Next.js 15 + React 19)
- Modern React with server components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time streaming interfaces
- Responsive design patterns

#### Backend (API Routes)
- LLM provider integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)
- E2B sandbox management
- File system operations
- Package management automation

#### Sandbox Environment (E2B + Vite)
- Isolated development containers
- Vite for fast development builds
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Hot module replacement

### Key Differentiators

1. **Multi-Model AI Support**: Not locked into single LLM provider
2. **Live Development Environment**: Immediate feedback and testing
3. **Surgical Code Editing**: Precise modifications without full rewrites
4. **Context Intelligence**: Maintains project and conversation awareness
5. **Zero Configuration**: Ready-to-use development environment

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics
- **Code Generation Accuracy**: >90% functional code on first generation
- **Sandbox Uptime**: 99.5% availability
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for simple edits, <30 seconds for full generations
- **Package Installation Success**: >95% automatic resolution

#### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to First App**: <2 minutes from start to working application
- **User Retention**: 70% return rate within 7 days
- **Session Duration**: Average 15+ minutes per session
- **Feature Adoption**: 80% use of edit features after first generation

### Roadmap & Future Enhancements

#### Phase 1 (Current)
- âœ… Core AI code generation
- âœ… Live sandbox environments  
- âœ… Multiple LLM support
- âœ… Basic editing capabilities

#### Phase 2 (Planned)
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced authentication (Clerk integration)
- ðŸ”„ Project persistence and sharing
- ðŸ”„ Advanced component libraries
- ðŸ”„ Team collaboration features

#### Phase 3 (Future)
- ðŸ“‹ Deployment automation
- ðŸ“‹ Advanced debugging tools
- ðŸ“‹ Performance optimization suggestions
- ðŸ“‹ Integration with external APIs

### Constraints & Limitations

#### Technical Constraints
- **Sandbox Timeout**: 15-minute development sessions
- **Model Context**: Limited conversation history (20 messages)
- **Package Support**: npm ecosystem only
- **Framework Limitation**: React/Vite applications only

#### Business Constraints
- **API Costs**: LLM provider usage costs
- **Infrastructure**: E2B sandbox provisioning limits
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU constraints in sandboxes

### Risk Assessment

#### High Priority Risks
- **LLM Provider Outages**: Implement multi-provider fallback
- **Sandbox Availability**: E2B service dependencies
- **Code Quality**: Generated code may contain bugs or security issues
- **Cost Management**: Uncontrolled LLM usage costs

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Code validation and security checks  
- Usage monitoring and rate limiting

### Competitive Analysis

#### Direct Competitors
- **Cursor**: AI-powered IDE
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI code completion
- **Replit**: Online development environment
- **CodeSandbox**: Browser-based development

#### Competitive Advantages
- **Multi-model AI**: Not vendor-locked
- **Complete Applications**: Full app generation, not just snippets
- **Live Preview**: Immediate visual feedback
- **Natural Language**: No coding knowledge required
